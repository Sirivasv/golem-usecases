What we should do on golem to amaze the world? (like: what specifically, what dataset, what solution, what algorithms, what architectures?)

Probably use Spearmint or Hyperopt or ... to find some metaparams.

Maybe implement something from kaggle? We might implement one of the winning solutions - but: 
 a) it can take a very long time (lots of ensembles)
 b) I'm not an expert (and by comparision people would find bugs or sth)
 3) idk if we find a solution which depends heavily on metaparams search (and that's our bet for now)

Tech used in last kaggles:
